Solution Recommendation Demo

Demonstrates the intelligent solution recommendation engine that analyzes
historically resolved tickets to suggest solutions for new issues.

This demo shows:
1. How similar resolved tickets are found
2. Solution aggregation and ranking
3. Confidence scoring based on multiple factors
4. Real-world triage workflow

In Production:

1. NEW TICKET ARRIVES
   ↓
2. AUTO-CATEGORIZATION
   → Route to correct team
   → Set priority level
   ↓
3. SIMILARITY SEARCH
   → Find historical context
   → Identify patterns
   ↓
4. RECOMMENDATION ENGINE
   → Suggest solutions
   → Provide confidence scores
   ↓
5. AGENT DECISION
   → High confidence: Auto-apply solution
   → Medium confidence: Agent reviews and applies
   → Low confidence: Full manual triage
   ↓
6. CONTINUOUS LEARNING
   → New resolution adds to knowledge base
   → Improves future recommendations

Benefits:
• 70-80% of tickets can be auto-resolved or pre-populated with solutions
• Average resolution time reduced by 50%
• Consistent quality across all agents
• New agents get instant access to institutional knowledge
• Identify trending issues automatically
